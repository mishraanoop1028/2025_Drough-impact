# SPI Analysis of Rainfall Data for Jaipur and Jodhpur Divisions (1980-2020)

## Description
This project calculates the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for 40 years of rainfall data in the semi-arid and arid regions of Jaipur and Jodhpur, Rajasthan. The SPI is calculated for multiple time scales (SPI-3, SPI-6, SPI-9, SPI-12, SPI-24, and SPI-36) to analyze drought trends and variability in rainfall patterns.

## Key Features
- Calculates SPI for 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 36-month time scales.
- Handles missing data and outliers in rainfall datasets.
- Visualizes SPI trends using graphs and plots.
- Compares SPI trends between Jaipur and Jodhpur divisions.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Rainfall data for Jaipur and Jodhpur divisions from 1980 to 2020.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and outliers.
3. **SPI Calculation**: Computed SPI for 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 36-month time scales.
4. **Visualization**: Created graphs to visualize SPI trends over time.
5. **Analysis**: Compared SPI trends between Jaipur and Jodhpur divisions.
